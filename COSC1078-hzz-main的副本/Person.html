        Project Ideas:
        <div class="line"></div>
        <div class="text2">
          <h>Overview</h><br>
          <p>Artificial intelligence is becoming more and more popular in today's society.
            I want to design a wardrobe related to artificial intelligence.
            This wardrobe is for many people who struggle with what to wear when they go out.The wardrobe inside for the clothes, the outside there is a large display, also used in the artificial intelligence technology, when the user put the clothes into the wardrobe, put the clothes in front of the screen, will enter the characteristics of this kind of clothes, and then when you want to go to some places, some kind of weather is suitable for what to wear, or other cases, you can speak these conditions to display, then the wardrobe will help you to select the right clothes for reference, and simulated wearing in the display.It is the user's butler of dress management.</p><br>
          <h>Motivation</h><br>
          <p>I think dress is very important, and some people have more clothes, so they need more time to choose their dress, and I think their dress will also affect them.For example, when President Barack Obama addressed a crowd of working class Americans, he would speak with no jacket and his sleeves rolled up?That silently and instantly communicated to the audience that he too was a hard worker.Very attractive people earn 22% more than their average looking peers. (Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, 2016).Attractive employees earn an average of roughly 5% more while unattractive employees earn can earn almost 9% less than average(Forbes, 2013).There's about a 10 to 15% difference in earnings between the most and least attractive employees in a group. (Cornell University, 2011)</p><br>
          <h>Description</h><br>
          <p>This intelligent wardrobe is made up of artificial intelligence equipment plus wardrobe and some other automation hardware equipment.The idea is as follows: a smart digital display in the middle of the wardrobe, which can be controlled by a touch screen, a remote control, or an app that allows users to control it via Bluetooth on their phone.On the display screen, it can display the time, weather, temperature and other basic information as well as the dry, wet and temperature conditions in the wardrobe.
            <br>  <br> This product can also add Bluetooth function, allowing users to connect via mobile phone Bluetooth, and can play music on it, perhaps also a good experience. When the user puts the clothes into the wardrobe, he scans in front of the display screen, and then starts to store various information of the clothes into the database, and places them to record the position of the clothes. The hangers in the closet are also specially made, marked with a number, and can be intelligently slid on the pole. According to the number of clothes, the hangers will automatically choose the interval between them. When the user needs to use it, such as going to a cocktail party, click to select the clothing function, and the condition "Go to the cocktail party" can be spoken to the display screen, and the system will analyze the data and select a few suits of clothing suitable for the cocktail party. For reference, the user can stand in front of the screen and click on the clothes to simulate dressing, and then they can feel whether they like the recommended clothes or not. If the user selects a piece of clothing, the system will give the hanger number or other location where the clothing is located.It is convenient for users to quickly take clothes and save time. At the same time, it is also envisaged that the user's physical characteristics can be scanned on the display screen, and some clothing suitable for the user's body can also be recommended for the user, which can be provided to the user to purchase when he goes to the store in the future.
            <br> <br>  Inside the wardrobe, there are also many smart products. Equipped with an automatic lifting rod, which allows the user to control the height of the clothes, and also can automatically lift to the appropriate height for the user to take the clothes when the user takes the clothes. In each different season, the interior of the wardrobe will automatically adjust the humidity and temperature. The preservation of the clothes in the closet is guaranteed. At night or when the lighting is low, the wardrobe will automatically turn on the lights when the user opens the wardrobe, making it more convenient for the user to take the clothes.
            <br> <br> This wardrobe has too many functions, and it is really difficult to realize it. If this smart wardrobe can be produced, the price will not be low, and it may only be suitable for some high-income people. If the future manufacturing cost can be reduced. It may be popularized a little bit.</p><br>
          <h>Tools and Technologies</h><br>
          <p>This smart wardrobe definitely needs some hardware and software cooperation. Software needs to use python or JVM series languages for programming, both of which are the preferred languages for artificial intelligence development. These programming languages are needed for functional realization. In order to achieve the overall function collocation. Also need to use Zigbee, RF433MHz, BLE, KNX, NB-IOT and other technologies. In terms of hardware, digital display screens, remote controls, smart lights, smart lift bars, etc. are needed. The open source tools that may need to be used are CNTK, Torch and other tools for speech recognition, image subtitles, image recognition, information analysis and other technologies.</p><br>
          <h>Skills Required</h><br>
          <p>This project needs a lot of program code to achieve, but also need hardware and software collocation.To realize the speech recognition of user dialogue, image recognition, data storage, data processing and analysis, which involves a lot of code.On the hardware side, you need a smart digital display that can be touched, can display data, can recognize voice, can broadcast voice, and a few other basic functions.The inside of the wardrobe also needs to have automatic lifting rods, temperature adjustment equipment, dry and wet adjustment equipment, and automatic induction to select the clothes to be worn.At present, this type of hardware and software should also exist. At present, there are some intelligent wardrobes on the market, but they do not seem to have the functions of the above products. By combining these technologies, this product may be realized.</p><br>
          <h>Outcome</h><br>
          <p>In the interior of the wardrobe, there are also a lot of intelligent products.It is equipped with automatic lifting lever, which allows users to control the height of placing clothes by themselves. It can also automatically lift to the appropriate height for users to take clothes when users take them.In each different season, the interior of the wardrobe will automatically adjust the humidity and temperature.Keep the clothes in your closet safe.When the user opens the wardrobe at night or at low lighting level, the wardrobe will automatically turn on the light, making it more convenient for the user to take the clothes.</p><br>
